## Usage
Spendwise's AI agent, powered by Watsonx AI, utilizes a RAG system where it loads user information to enhance the AI's ability to provide more personalized and relevant responses. You can interact with the agent by navigating to the "Jarvis AI" button in the right-hand corner. From there, you can choose from the recommended questions or type in your own. The AI will process your input and respond based on the data it has access to. Feel free to explore different scenarios to see how the AI adapts its responses.
