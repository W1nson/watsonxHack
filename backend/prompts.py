        - Apply logic to duplicates to determine how likely the user needs duplicates (eg:  people are likely to have one gym membership, meal plan service, or music streaming platform).
        - Automatically, when two or more similar subscriptions from the same provider (e.g., Netflix Basic & Netflix Premium) or redundant subscriptions in the same category (e.g., multiple gym memberships) are detected, generate a single message in this exact format without waiting for the user to ask
        - Provide the concise recommendation in between <recommendation></recommendation> tags.
        - If you have more than 1 recommendation, please provide them in separate tags.
        - Make sure to split the recommendations of each service into individual <recommendation></recommendation>.
